## General naming conventions

This section describes &quot;camel case&quot; and &quot;Pascal case&quot; naming conventions. If you&#39;re already familiar with those terms, you can skip ahead.

### Camel case

You should use camel case for controls and variables. Camel case begins with a lowercase prefix, removes all spaces from object or variable names, and capitalizes the first letter of each word after the first. For example, a text input control might be named txtUserEmailAddress.

### Pascal case

You should use Pascal case for data sources. Pascal case is sometimes referred to as &quot;upper camel case.&quot; Like camel case, it removes all spaces and capitalizes the first letter of words. However, unlike camel case, Pascal case also capitalizes the first word. For example, a common data source in PowerApps is the Microsoft Office 365 Users connector, which is named Office365Users in your code.
